MARBLE QUEST
=============
Created by Kevin Scott, February, 2013


Description
-------

A game where you are the marble and you roll to your goal.

Input device is an accelerometer, which moves the marble around the goal.

Your time is recorded and used to award you a certain number of hearts after completion of the level.

Code
-------
Most of the code is abstracted out into classes for modularity and clarity of purpose. A bulk of
the code resides in the Board class.

The LED matrix is capable of reading in float values and doing variable brightness.

Levels
-------
More levels were intended; unfortunately, I ran out of memory. C'est la vie. There are two HTML files which are used to create levels. Included for posterity.
